## How to contribute to the database?
To get your catalogue listed in the database you will need to apply and have it accepted. 

To apply you will need to make a pull request with your proposed documentation for review.
 - check out this repository 
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:GNS-Science/nz-eq-cat-database.git
```
 - create a branch 
```bash
  git branch your-cat
  git checkout your-cat
```
- add your catalogue to the list in the *.csv* and fill all the necessary information;
- if you are submitting a catalogue, fill out the application form and place it in the `application/` folder;
- commit, make a pull request.

```bash
 git add .
 git commit -m "my message"
 git push
 ```

You should make an effort to consider the information you are submitting, detailling the methods used to build the catalogue you submitted and verify the accuracy of your application before making the pull request.
